    Prepare necessary information for later communications in forward and backward passes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    comm : Communicator
        The global MPI communicator.
    rank : int
        The global rank of the process.
    mp_size : int
        Model Parallel size.
    dp_size : int
        Data Parallel size.
    fc_layer : str
        Identifier for the fully-connected layer. It must be one of:
        'fc_q', 'fc_k', 'fc_v', or 'fc_o'.
        - For 'fc_q', 'fc_k', and 'fc_v', the partitioning is along the output dimension.

    dp_idx : int
        Data parallel index (which replica this process belongs to).
    mp_comm : Communicator
        The model parallel communicator (all processes in one data parallel replica).

    ----------

    Use reduce-scatter / all-to-all to combine the contributions for grad_x from all nodes

    The grad_x tensor (gradient with respect to fc_o's input) has shape
        (batch_size, seq_length, in_dim),
    and the fc_o's weight matrix is sharded along the in_dim axis. In the 
    backward pass, each node computes a local grad_x and then these must be 
    summed across nodes. Instead of summing the full tensor and then slicing,
    we perform a reduce-scatter / all-to-all.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    grad_x : np.ndarray
        The locally computed grad_x for fc_o, of shape 
        (batch_size, seq_length, in_dim).
    mp_comm :
        The model parallel communicator. It is assumed to expose methods such as reduce-scatter / all-to-all.
    mp_size : int
        The total number of model parallel nodes.
    
    Returns
    -------
    collected_grad_x : np.ndarray
